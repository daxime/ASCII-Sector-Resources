## 🌌 ASCII Sector: The Text-Based Space Adventure
ASCII Sector is a free game that revives the spirit of legendary combat, trading, and space exploration games such as Elite and Privateer, all wrapped up in a graphical interface made entirely from ASCII art. Yes, all the ships, planets, and characters are made from simple text characters, and it's absolutely beautiful (for those who appreciate minimalist aesthetics!).

Start with a simple spaceship, accept missions or trade goods to earn enough money and upgrade your ship or buy a new one. Engage in deadly fights both in space, on the ground and on board spaceships.

With the Ascii Sector scripting language, you can create your own quests for the game or have fun with other player's quests.

**Latest version: 0.7.2**

**Released: January 22nd, 2016**

***Latest MS-DOS version : 0.3.1***
